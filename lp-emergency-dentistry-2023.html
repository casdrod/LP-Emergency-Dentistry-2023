                <h2>Most Common Dental Emergencies</h2>
                <p>We understand. Dental emergencies are tough to predict, and it is even more difficult to figure out what is causing the pain. Because we handle more emergencies in a month than many dentists see in a year, we can find solutions quickly. We start with a same-day appointment, and your visit will include a thorough exam and the necessary x-rays. Most importantly, we will treat you with respect and get you back on a path to a healthy, beautiful smile.  Call now to schedule your same-day appointment.</p>

                        <p>When you or a loved one is in dental pain, having to wait for care is the absolute worst. That’s what happens to most emergency dental patients in standard ERs, but at Arts Family Dentistry we know time is of the essence. That’s why we offer same-day appointments for all emergency patients. Just give our Emergency Hotline a call, and we’ll schedule you so we can help you as fast.</p>

                        </h2>
                        <p>We realize the importance of taking care of your teeth, and we welcome dental insurance as a partner in making exceptional dentistry affordable.  If you are fortunate enough to have PPO dental insurance, call us.  We work closely with all the leading plans, and our team will help you understand and maximize your benefits.</p>
                        <p>If you need assistance to pay for the remainder of your treatment, or if you are preparing for dental care not covered by your insurance carrier, why not enroll in a low or no-interest payment plan with CareCredit? This makes it easy to break up your treatment into manageable monthly payments that fit more closely with your budget.</p>
                        <p>If you’re interested in third-party financing, we are pleased to partner with Sunbit Financing. Not only does it have a quick and easy approval process, but the payment plans are convenient and personalized according to your needs. Along the way, you can change the amount of your monthly payment, making it even more convenient!</p>
